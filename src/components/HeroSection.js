    description="I'm a Full Stack Java Developer with a proven background as a Software Quality Assurance Lead. I recently completed an intensive coding bootcamp at Tech Elevator, where I built full-stack applications using Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap.
    What sets me apart is my foundation in quality-first thinking. With years of experience leading QA efforts across production systems, I bring a deep understanding of how to build software that is robust, testable, and user-focused. I anticipate edge cases, design for maintainability, and bring a disciplined approach to both development and collaboration.
    In transitioning to a full-stack role, I've combined my strengths in testing, problem-solving, and team communication with hands-on development experience. My projects reflect not only technical ability but also an attention to detail and a commitment to delivering reliable, scalable solutions.
    If my background or work resonates with you, feel free to explore my repositories or connectâ€”I'm always open to thoughtful conversations about technology, development, and building better software.
